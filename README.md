## ML-Model-Flask-Deployment
This is a demostration project to explain how Machine Learning Models are deployed on production using Flask API , docker and HEROKU 

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) , Flask (for API) installed , Docker ( for deployement )a and a heroku account .

### Project Structure
This project has six major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code for our Machine Learning model to predict house prices absed on trainign data in 'HousePricing.csv' file.
2. app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. request.py - This uses requests module to call APIs already defined in app.py and dispalys the returned value.
4. templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter house detail and displays the predicted house price.
5. requirements.txt ; procfile - necessary files for the deployement of the heroku app .
6. Visual.ipynb - This contains the visualisations of the data on a dash application.

### Running the project on Flask
1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory. Create the machine learning model by running below command -
```
python model.py
```
This would create a serialized version of our model into a file model.pkl

2. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python app.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage as below :

Enter valid numerical values in all 5 input boxes and hit Predict.

If everything goes well, you should  be able to see the predcited house price vaule on the HTML page!

4. You can also send direct POST requests to FLask API using Python's inbuilt request module
Run the beow command to send the request with some pre-popuated values -
```
python request.py
```

### Running the project on Docker 
1. Ensure that you have Docker installed and that you're in the project home directory . Create the dockerized image by running the following command -
```
docker image build -t flask
```
2. To make sure that your image has been created , run the following command 
```
docker image ls 
```
3. Now we should run our image :
```
docker run -it  -p 5000:5000 -d flask 
```


### Deploying the app to Heroku 
1. Ensure that you have a heroku account -
2. Deploy the app on heroku using the git repository -
3. You should be able to have the following app :

### Data Visualisation on Dash 
1. Run the visual.ipynb file
2. Navigate to the generated URL : http://127.0.0.1:8050/
3 . Here's what your visualisations app will look like :
